# react-native-init-shadow

Initialize shadow-cljs projects to target react-native. This project
uses the existing `react-native-init` cli to generate the project's
base, and will generate the project using the latest stable
react-native version.

## Usage

shadow-cljs and react-native must already be installed.

```shell
$ npx react-native-init-shadow MyProjectName
```

Options 

```shell
# Install a specific react-native version. Note that
# react-native-windows may not work with the latest RN.
$ npx react-native-init-shadow MyProjectName --version 0.62.2
```

```shell
# Generate a desktop (windows + macos) project, or a mobile (ios +
# android) project.
$ npx react-native-init-shadow MyProjectName --platform desktop|mobile
```

```shell
# Set the package name for Android
$ npx react-native-init-shadow MyProjectName --package com.mycompany.MyProjectName
```
